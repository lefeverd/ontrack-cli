// branchSetPropertyCmd represents the branchSetProperty command
var branchSetPropertyCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "set-property",
	Short: "Sets a property on a branch",
	Long: `Sets a property on a branch.
	
This can be used for setting generic properties, using their full qualified class name and some JSON content:
	
	ontrack-cli branch set-property --project PROJECT --branch BRANCH generic --property "net.nemerosa.ontrack.extension.git.property.GitBranchConfigurationPropertyType" --value '{branch:"main"}'

Some specific commands are also available for the most common property types. The example below does exactly the
same update than the one just above:

	ontrack-cli branch set-property --project PROJECT --branch BRANCH git --git-branch main
`,
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {},
}

func init() {
	branchCmd.AddCommand(branchSetPropertyCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// branchSetPropertyCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")
	branchSetPropertyCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("project", "p", "", "Name of the project")
	branchSetPropertyCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("branch", "b", "", "Name of the branch")

	branchSetPropertyCmd.MarkPersistentFlagRequired("project")
	branchSetPropertyCmd.MarkPersistentFlagRequired("branch")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// branchSetPropertyCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
