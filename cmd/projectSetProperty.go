	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

// projectSetPropertyCmd represents the projectSetProperty command
var projectSetPropertyCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "set-property",
	Short: "Sets a property on a project",
	Long: `Sets a property on a project.
	
This can be used for setting generic properties, using their full qualified class name and some JSON content:
	
	ontrack-cli project set-property --project PROJECT generic --property "net.nemerosa.ontrack.extension.git.property.GitProjectConfigurationPropertyType" --value '{"configuration":"GitHub","repository":"nemerosa/ontrack"}'

Some specific commands are also available for the most common property types. The example below does exactly the
same update than the one just above:

	ontrack-cli project set-property --project PROJECT github --configuration GitHub --repository nemerosa/ontrack
`,
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {},
}

func init() {
	projectCmd.AddCommand(projectSetPropertyCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	projectSetPropertyCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("project", "p", "", "Name of the project")
	projectSetPropertyCmd.MarkPersistentFlagRequired("project")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// projectSetPropertyCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
