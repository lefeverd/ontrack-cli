// promotionLevelCmd represents the promotionLevel command
var promotionLevelCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:     "promotion-level",
	Aliases: []string{"promotion", "pl"},
	Short:   "Management of promotion levels",
	Long: `Management of promotion levels.

The simplest way to setup a promotion level for a branch:

    ontrack-cli pl setup -p PROJECT -b BRANCH -l PROMOTION

This will create a promotion level for the branch, or updates it if it exists already.
`,
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(promotionLevelCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// promotionLevelCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")
	promotionLevelCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("project", "p", "", "Name of the project")
	promotionLevelCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("branch", "b", "", "Name of the branch")

	promotionLevelCmd.MarkPersistentFlagRequired("project")
	promotionLevelCmd.MarkPersistentFlagRequired("branch")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// promotionLevelCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
