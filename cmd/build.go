// buildCmd represents the build command
var buildCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "build",
	Short: "Management of builds",
	Long: `Management of builds.

While you can create builds directly using:

    ontrack-cli build create --project my-project --branch release/1.0 --build 1

the 'build' command will be typically used to setup, in an idempotent way,
a build. For example:

    ontrack-cli build setup --project my-project --branch release/1.0 --build 1

See 'ontrack-cli build' for a list of other options.

	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(buildCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// buildCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// buildCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
